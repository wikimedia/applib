# wikimedia-page-library
A library for common JavaScript transforms and CSS used by both the Android and iOS Wikipedia apps. Please report issues on [Phabricator].

## Background
Presently we are consolidating duplicate Android and iOS Wikipedia app implementations of certain JavaScript transformations, such as image widening. **wikimedia-page-library** is where we are placing these consolidated JavaScript transform implementations.

### What wikimedia-page-library is for
- JavaScript transforms common to **both** the Android and iOS Wikipedia apps.
- Transform-specific CSS.
- Minimal CSS overrides that complement service output but for one reason or another is impractical to change elsewhere.

### What wikimedia-page-library is not for

- Style-only changes wanted by all clients. These should probably live in [Common.css].
- Template or extension-specific style or HTML changes wanted by all clients.
- Style or HTML changes wanted by all apps. In the long term these should probably live in Parsoid or a Parsoid-based service such as the [Mobile Content Service] or Page Content Service.

[Mobile Content Service]: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Team/RESTBase_services_for_apps

### What wikimedia-page-library delivers
- **wikimedia-page-library-transform.js** bundle of all transform JS
- **wikimedia-page-library-transform.css** bundle of all CSS required by the bundled transform JS
- **wikimedia-page-library-override.js** an unwanted [extraneous build product] that may safely be ignored
- **wikimedia-page-library-override.css** optional CSS overrides for improved appearance that are independent of transforms

## Conventions

### File locations and naming

Example file names and locations for an image widening transform:
- **src/transform/WidenImage.js** - the transform. *required*
- **src/transform/WidenImage.css** - CSS used by the transform. *optional*
- **src/override/Empty.css** - CSS overrides that are independent of transforms and that couldn't be upstreamed
- **test/WidenImage.test.js** - tests of the transform. *required*
- **test/fixtures/WidenImage.html** - fixtures used by transform tests. *optional*

*todo: rename Empty.css to a real override.*

Directory names should be lowercase. Filenames should be singular.

### Functional
- Prefer to read and modify the CSS class list rather than style attributes or computed styles and prefer to avoid usage of `!important` unless it's necessary for the class styles to be effective. This allows clients to customize appearance with CSS overrides and no JavaScript changes or effects. For example, **WidenImage.js** mentioned above could add/remove a class name from **WidenImage.css** to an element's class list to help achieve image widening.
- Prefer Minerva and Parsoid style defaults. Any deviations should be deliberate and tightly scoped.
- Wide screen selectors should apply to devices in landscape orientation or portrait orientation and >= 768px wide.
- Prefer `undefined` to `null`.

### Naming
- JS function names use camelCase
- JS module names use PascalCase
- CSS class names use snake_case; `pagelib_class_name_element_state` (note: class name omits the word "Transform").

### Design
- [Colors](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/source/wikimedia-ui-base/browse/master/wikimedia-ui-base.css) adhere to the [Wikimedia UI Style Guide](https://wikimedia.github.io/WikimediaUI-Style-Guide/).
- Theme-specific CSS rules should appear in one of the following files:
  - If a related transform exists, directly below any default / non-themed rule or at least in the transform's CSS file.
  - Otherwise, if a default override rule exists, directly below it.
  - Otherwise in ThemeTransform.css.
- Legacy-specific CSS fallback rules should appear in one of the following files:
  - If a related transform exists, directly above any default / non-compatibility rule or at least in the transform's CSS file.
  - Otherwise, if a default override rule exists, directly above it.
  - Otherwise in CompatibilityTransform.css.

## Development setup and workflow

### Debugging production code while running tests
To be able to get breakpoints to work in your production code you'll want to use the (in memory)
webpack-dev-server instead of the regular build output. To run it:
```sh
npm run -s build:watch
```

### NPM
The /page/mobile-html endpoint, plus the Android and iOS Wikipedia apps make use of the `wikimedia-page-library`. At some point their respective build phases invoke `npm install` which causes a *published* version of this library to be retrieved and used in their respective builds.

But sometimes we want to test *unpublished* `wikimedia-page-library` branches. This could be to review bug fixes or new feature branches or to develop fixes and features ourselves. We'd like to be able to checkout a local branch of `wikimedia-page-library` and run the app's build process and have the app use whatever we had checked out of our local copy of `wikimedia-page-library`.

To do this:

**Step 1** (only need to do this once)

Create a local clone of `wikimedia-page-library`:
```
git clone https://github.com/wikimedia/wikimedia-page-library.git
```

**Step 2** (do this as needed)

Checkout the branch to be tested:
```
cd wikimedia-page-library
git checkout somebranch
```

and run the debug build:
```
npm run -s build:debug
```

**Step 3** (only need to do this once)

Now we need to temporarily tell NPM to use our local copy of `wikimedia-page-library` so when we run the app's build process and it runs `npm install`, our local copy of `wikimedia-page-library` will be used instead of the published one.

We can use the `npm link` command to do this.

Create a `wikimedia-page-library` symlink:
```
cd wikimedia-page-library
npm link
```

The `npm link` command above configures NPM with a global `wikimedia-page-library` symlink. Note that it infers the name of the package from the package folder we `cd`'ed into. We will use this symlink in the next step. You only have to create this symlink once as long as you don't change the file system location of your local clone of `wikimedia-page-library`.

**Step 4** (do this when you begin testing against a local copy)

Now we have to configure the app to point to the symlink we just created.
```
cd $NATIVE_APP_REPO/www # Replace $NATIVE_APP_REPO with the path to the Android or iOS repo.
npm link wikimedia-page-library
```

After running the `link` command above, your file system browser should show a symlink folder for `www/node_modules/wikimedia-page-library` instead of a normal folder.

Now NPM is "pointing" to our local copy of `wikimedia-page-library` and when the app's build process invokes `npm install` NPM will try to get `wikimedia-page-library` build products from our local copy.

**Step 5** (do this each time you make a change to the local copy)

*Important!*

Don't forget to rebuild the local copy of `wikimedia-page-library` any time you make a change to it (before you run the app's build process), otherwise the app's build process won't "see" the change!
```
cd wikimedia-page-library
npm run -s build
```

You may find it helpful to combine this step's command with a command kicking of the respective app's build process into a shortcut of some kind. Most of the development workflow involves make a change to your local copy of `wikimedia-page-library`, telling that local copy to re-build, then telling the app to rebuild.

**Step 6** (do this when you are done testing against the local copy)

When you have finished testing against your local copy of `wikimedia-page-library`, you can simply `unlink` so the app's build process will again pull from the *published* version of `wikimedia-page-library`.
```
cd $NATIVE_APP_REPO/www # Replace $NATIVE_APP_REPO with the path to the Android or iOS repo.
npm unlink wikimedia-page-library
```

Note the `un` in the command above.

After running the `unlink` command above, your file system browser should again show a normal folder for `www/node_modules/wikimedia-page-library` instead of a symlink folder.

### Supported ES6 syntax
Babel transpiles ES6 syntax to ES5 except for...of, spread, array destructuring, spread, generators, and async functions. Additionally, ES6 built-ins such as `Array.from()` are not transpiled. babel-polyfill is not a requirement of this library so do not use these features.

https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/caveats/#polyfills

### Automatic incremental builds
`npm run -s build:watch` will monitor and automatically rebuild the JavaScript and CSS bundles when files change. When used with NPM linking, this allows the app to always pull the latest local changes.

### Demo
Demos are viewable by running `npm -s start` which also updates the browser instantly for changes.

#### Adding new demo article
Note: These are only used by the theme transform demo.
1. Add new article in `DemoArticles/articles.json`
2. Run `./update.js` in `DemoArticles/`
3. Commit `articles.json` and the two new article fetches (ignore the changes to the existing files - sometimes changes to existing data files happens when structural html or timestamp changes occur upstream)

### Testing
Tests are executed prior to commits but may also be executed manually:

- Run all tests: `npm -s t`
- Run all tests for a module: `npm -s t -- -g ElementUtilities`
- Run all tests for a method: `npm -s t -- -g 'isNestedInTable()'`

### Lint
ESLint is executed prior to commits and publishing to identify cataloged style and functionality concerns. Linting may also be performed by running `npm run -s lint:all`. When a violation is detected, it may be fixed manually or suppressed by [selectively disabling the rule] (e.g, `// eslint-disable-line no-magic-number`). Some rules support automated fixes via `npm run -s lint -- --fix .`.

When linting fails with a mysterious error message like, the following removing the `.eslintcache` file should help.
```
TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object
    at Function.keys (<anonymous>)
    at Object.keys (node_modules/flat-cache/cache.js:52:19)
```
